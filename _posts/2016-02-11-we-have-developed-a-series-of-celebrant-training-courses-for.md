Welcome to the United Kingdom Society of Celebrants

We are a forward thinking professional body that actively promotes and supports our Members in their service provision and are at the forefront of developing and implementing professional standards and the provision of quality Celebrant Training.

What Do Celebrants Do?

Our Civil Celebrants provide a truly bespoke service to their clients, by working with them, their families, friends and others our celebrants will write and deliver the ceremony their clients want, where and when they want it.

### Say NO : to standard ceremonies at churches and registry offices where they just substitute names in a pre-set service.

Say YES : to bespoke, memorable, meaningful, personal and inclusive ceremonies at a location of your choice.
